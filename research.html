        <h2>My Research</h2>
        <p> Welcome to my research page! <br><br>
            I started researching with Dr. Ananya Sen Gupta during my undergrad. As an undergrad researcher
            I worked on multiple projects and gained insight on using MATLAB as a signal processing tool as well
            as revising research documents. My work included breaking down a complex algorithm used to analyze oil
            weathering from the Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill
            <br><br> I continued my education and focused on signal processing for chemicals contained in milk samples, 
            working along side the FDA. I learned about multiple techniques, such as using peak energies to quantify a 
            signal to implement a comparison algorithm, finding items relative to one another, Principal Component Analysis, 
            and K-Means Clustering. The goal of this research was to find analytes that appear in multiple samples that may 
            need to be targeted. 
            <br><br> 
            My current reserach pivoted to a new domain in space physics. I now help scientists in heliophysics that 
            analyze phenomena like space weather, trying to give them the most reliable data. To study these phenomena,
            magnetometers are flown into space. The spacecraft they are on also has its own magnetic field and
            can impact the data. 
            <br><br>
            I enjoy the interdisciplinary work that I can be apart of and hope to continue to learn more about the complexities of 
            how information evolves in complicated systems, such as the human body, specifically the brain.

                    <br>Missions focused on space weather require magnetic field measurements. 
                    Satellite subsystems can emit their own magnetic field, 
                    interfering with the data. One such subsystem includes reaction wheels, 
                    which are commonly used for attitude control. The CASSIOPE/SwarmEcho satellite 
                    is a perfect example where the time-varying reaction wheel 
                    noise overlays the target geophysical signals. Typically, Ness-gradiometry 
                    is utilized where the difference between the two vector magnetometers at 
                    different distances from the spacecraft gives an estimate of the noise 
                    that can be subtracted. With shorter booms, the sensors experience a 
                    more complex multi-pole noise source necessitating additional signal 
                    processing to mitigate. We explore analyzing the signal in the frequency    
                    domain, where the fundamental and harmonics signatures of the reaction    
                    wheels are targeted and removed. We present our findings using data 
                    collected from the CASSIOPE/Swarm-Echo satellite as a case study

                    <i>Hesto Conference</i>
                    <br>Space science missions seeking to take magnetic field measurements are susceptible to local magnetic 
                    interference from common for satellite subsystems, including reaction wheels, magnetorquers, solar panels, 
                    etc. Magnetic screening and other characterization tests help in identifying sources of interference and, 
                    in some cases, mitigating them by design. Historical algorithms, such as the Ness technique, are reasonably
                    effective at removing some magnetic sources and preserving the geophysical field. However, complex and 
                    time-varying magnetic interference has been a significant challenge and in recent years, multiple algorithms
                     have been developed with the goal of mitigating complex the interference signals. Here, we present a case 
                     study of our method, in which we perform feature separation of reaction wheels by utilizing information from 
                     two vector magnetometers along a boom. In particular, we present results from the e-POP/Swarm-Echo mission. 
                     We also discuss how the presented methodology is broadly applicable beyond the e-POP mission and the specific 
                     application used in this case study.

                    <i>AGU Fall Meeting 2023</i>
                    <br>Magnetic interference mitigation for onboard spacecraft instruments is paramount for accurate geophysical 
                    magnetometer data. It is an active research area to separate the interference signal caused by the spacecraft 
                    from the geophysical background signal. We address this challenge using signal processing techniques employed 
                    across both the time and frequency domains. A case study of our algorithm, focusing on topological connectivity
                    in the spectral domain, has been performed on e-POP/Swarm-Echo mission. However, there is no proper way to evaluate
                    whether the algorithm maintained the geophysical signal correctly. A new laboratory-generated dataset that mimics
                    noise sources, like the reaction wheel, has been created at the University of Iowa and further developed at 
                    Goddard. We will present how our algorithm performed in multiple scenarios where the noise source signature and
                    simulated geophysical signature are known. From there, we determine the limitations of our algorithm and pinpoint
                    specific examples that may be of interest to noise mitigation developers. This work was support in part by US 
                    Airforce Office of Scientific Research grant FA9550-21-1-0206. The e-POP/Swarm-Echo mission is supported by 
                    the European Space Agency's Third Party Mission Programme. e-POP/Swarm-Echo data are available at
